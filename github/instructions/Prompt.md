# "Help Me Modernize" - MCP-Powered Legacy Code Documentation Tool

Every major step must be followed by updating the BuildingNotes.md file with what work has been done and why that work was done. 

## Project Overview

Build a TypeScript-based tool called "Help Me Modernize" that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to help government developers understand, document, and improve legacy code. This project demonstrates the core responsibilities of a Developer Relations Engineer by creating a comprehensive sample application that showcases best practices, serves as educational material, and addresses real developer needs.

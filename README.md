Interactive learning platform teaching **MCP architecture**, **AI integration**, and **enterprise TypeScript** through hands-on legacy code modernization. Students build real applications while exploring government compliance patterns as educational framework.

> **Portfolio Goal**: Showcase ability to create educational tools that make complex enterprise concepts accessible through practical experience.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **MCP Server Design**: Model Context Protocol as primary application architecture
- **AI Integration**: Claude API with structured prompts and error handling  
- **Enterprise TypeScript**: 65+ tests, strict typing, government-grade patterns
- **Real-World Skills**: Legacy analysis (COBOL, Java, SQL), security, compliance

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd help-me-modernize
npm install && npm run build

# Web interface (works without API key)
npm run start:web

# Full AI features (optional)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" > .env
```

## 🏗️ Educational Architecture

**Learning Pattern**: MCP Server as Primary Application
```
Web Interface ◄──► MCP Server ◄──► AI Analysis ◄──► Legacy Code
```

**Key Learning Components**: 4 MCP tools, comprehensive testing (65 tests), multi-format outputs, educational comments throughout codebase.

## 🧪 Hands-On Labs

**Lab 1**: TypeScript Patterns → `npm run typecheck`  
**Lab 2**: Testing Strategy → `npm test` (80% coverage)  
**Lab 3**: AI Integration → Study `src/analyzers/` for prompt engineering  
**Lab 4**: Enterprise Compliance → `npm audit && npm run lint` (120+ rules)

## 📚 Study Guide

1. **MCP Implementation**: `src/mcp/HelpMeModernizeServer.ts` - comprehensive educational comments
2. **Testing Patterns**: `tests/` - 65 tests demonstrating enterprise quality assurance
3. **AI Integration**: `src/analyzers/` - structured AI responses and error handling
4. **Build Process**: `Documentation/BuildingNotes.md` - complete development journey

## 🎯 Self-Assessment

- Can you explain MCP architecture benefits over REST APIs?
- How does the testing strategy ensure AI application reliability?
- What enterprise patterns could apply to other domains?
- How would you extend this for different programming languages?

## 🤝 Contributing

Educational contributions welcome! Focus on enhancing learning value:
- New analysis types for other legacy languages
- Guided tutorials for specific concepts  
- Assessment features for learning validation

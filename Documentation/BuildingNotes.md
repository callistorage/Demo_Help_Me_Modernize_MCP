### Debugging Session - Server Startup Issues (Resolved)

**Problem**: After successful builds, server would exit immediately without error messages or startup confirmation.

**Investigation Process**:
1. Added comprehensive console.log statements throughout `server.ts` 
2. Traced execution flow from imports through server initialization
3. Discovered ES module detection logic was failing silently
4. Issue: `import.meta.url` comparison logic wasn't working with tsx runner

**Root Cause**: The ES module detection in server.ts was comparing file paths incorrectly:
```typescript
// Failing logic:
if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) 

// Fixed logic:  
if (path.resolve(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)) === path.resolve(process.argv[1]))
```

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated ES module detection to use proper path resolution
- Used `fileURLToPath()` and `path.resolve()` for accurate comparison
- Maintained all debug logging for verification

**Verification Results**:
```
✅ All imports successful
✅ WebServer constructor complete  
✅ MCP server initialized
✅ Express server started on port 3000
✅ "Help Me Modernize is ready for government legacy code analysis!"
```

**Status**: Server successfully running at http://localhost:3000

### Current System Status: ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE

**Foundation Implementation**: 100% Complete

## Recent Fixes - August 17, 2025

### Character Encoding Issues Resolved
**Problem**: COBOL files containing characters outside Latin1 range caused `btoa()` encoding errors
**Solution**: 
- Replaced server-side `Buffer.from()` with browser-compatible `safeBase64Encode()` function
- Uses `TextEncoder` API to handle UTF-8 characters properly
- Maintains compatibility with all legacy character sets

### AI Model Updates
**Updated to Claude 4** (Development): Using `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for enhanced legacy code analysis
**Government Consideration**: FedRAMP environments should use `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` as the most recent authorized model
**Benefits**: 
- Improved COBOL and legacy language understanding
- Enhanced government compliance analysis
- Better security vulnerability detection
